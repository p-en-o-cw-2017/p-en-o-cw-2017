The drone consists of an engine and four airfoils (the two wings and the
horizontal and vertical stabilizers). In the drone coordinate system,
- the drone's center of gravity is at (0, 0, 0)
- the left wing is at (-wingX, 0, 0). (That is, its mass is modeled as a point
  mass at that location, and its lift force is modeled as a point force at that
  location.
- the right wing is at (wingX, 0, 0)
- the horizontal and vertical stabilizers are at (0, 0, tailSize)
- the engine is somewhere on the negative Z axis. (Its location is determined
  by the fact that the center of gravity is at (0, 0, 0).) Its mass, too, is
  modeled as a point mass and its thrust force as a point force at the same
  location.
The drone coordinate system is right-handed; (0, 1, 0) points towards the top
of the drone.

The drone's geometry is not completely fixed: each airfoil can be rotated
around an axis. We define each airfoil's axis vector as follows:
- The axis vector of both wings and of the horizontal stabilizer is (1, 0, 0).
- The axis vector of the vertical stabilizer is (0, 1, 0).

We define each airfoil's attack vector as follows:
- The left wing's attack vector is (0, sin(leftWingInclination), -cos(leftWingInclination)).
- The right wing's attack vector is (0, sin(rightWingInclination), -cos(rightWingInclination)).
- The horizontal stabilizer's attack vector is (0, sin(horStabInclination), -cos(horStabInclination)).
- The vertical stabilizer's attack vector is (-sin(verStabInclination), 0, -cos(verStabInclination)).

We define an airfoil's normal as the cross product of its axis vector and its
attack vector.

We define an airfoil's projected airspeed vector as its airspeed vector (its
velocity minus the wind velocity) projected onto the plane perpendicular to its
axis vector. We define its projected airspeed as the size of its projected
airspeed vector. We define its angle of attack as -atan2(S . N, S . A), where S
is the projected airspeed vector, N is the normal, and A is the attack vector.

The forces operating on the drone, in drone coordinates, are the following:
- Gravity applies to each of the four point masses
- The engine thrust force vector is (0, 0, -thrust)
- Each airfoil generates a lift force N . liftSlope . AOA . s^2, where N is the
  normal, AOA is the angle of attack, and s is the projected airspeed.  No
  other forces operate on the drone; in particular, there is no drag.

The drone has a camera located at (0, 0, 0) and looking towards (0, 0, -1).
(The drone (including the engine) is transparent to this camera; it does not block any part of its view.)

The direction of gravity is (0, -1, 0) in world coordinates. The world coordinate
system is right-handed.

All physical quantities are expressed in SI units; all angles are expressed in
radians.
